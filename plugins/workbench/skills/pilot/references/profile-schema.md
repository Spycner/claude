# Workbench Pilot Profile Schema

This document defines the convention for `.workbench/pilot.md` files in projects that use the `workbench:pilot` skill.

## What goes in the profile

Workbench owns the reusable pilot loop (the ten steps, the gates, the invariants). Projects own their local reality through this profile. The profile is intentionally small: most project information that pilot needs (default branch, task runner, paths) is already documented in `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` and reaches the agent through regular session context. The profile carries the pilot-specific bits that don't naturally belong in a project's root memory file: PR behavior, gates, improvement pass, hooks, required-skills overrides.

## Discovery (v1)

The pilot skill looks for **one** file: `.workbench/pilot.md` in the repo root. Missing file is a hard stop; pilot refuses to run and points the user at the example profile.

The broader fallback chain enumerated in issue 23 (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.workbench/pilot.yaml|yml`) is **deferred**. None of those branches are walked in v1. They are documented here as future enumerations:

- `.workbench/pilot.yaml` and `.workbench/pilot.yml`: enable when there is a concrete parser-consuming use case (validation script, profile linter).
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md` fallback: enable when there is demand for "pilot in a repo without a `.workbench/` directory."

Until then, projects that want pilot create `.workbench/pilot.md` explicitly.

## Markdown-first stance (no parser)

Headings are conventions, not contracts. Both Claude Code and Codex consume the profile as prompt context; there is no parser anywhere. The pilot skill reads the recommended shape and extracts what it needs section by section.

YAML support is deferred until a concrete parser-consuming use case exists.

## Profile shape

### Recommended minimum

```md
# Workbench Pilot Profile

## PR behavior

Mode: stop_at_green
```

This is the suggested starting point. Adoption is explicit (you opted in by creating the file); the body is overrides on defaults.

### Truly minimal (also valid)

An empty `.workbench/pilot.md` is valid. Presence of the file is the opt-in signal.

### Full heading vocabulary (all optional)

| `## Project-specific rules` | none beyond what `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` provides                                                                                                                                                 |

## Bootstrap precedence

When the pilot skill needs project information, it resolves each field in this order:

1. Profile section in `.workbench/pilot.md`.
2. Session context (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, both already loaded into the agent).
3. Git or filesystem detection (`git symbolic-ref`, presence of `mise.toml`, etc.).
4. Ask the user. Never guess.

A field that no source provides and the active step needs (for example, a test command in a project with neither `mise.toml` nor `Makefile` nor `package.json`) stops the workflow with a question, not a guess.

## PR behavior modes

| Mode             | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stop_at_green`  | Default. Pilot stops once CI is green and reports the PR URL. The user merges manually.                                                                                                                        |
| `automerge`      | Pilot runs `gh pr merge <pr> --auto --squash` (or `--merge` if `Squash: no`), polls until the PR state is `MERGED`, refreshes local default branch, deletes the feature branch, reports the merged commit hash. |
| `request_review` | Pilot runs `gh pr ready` and posts a reviewer note; merge stays manual.                                                                                                                                        |

## Hooks

Each hook value is a shell command. The pilot skill substitutes `{{pr}}`, `{{branch}}`, `{{spec_path}}`, `{{plan_path}}` into the command before invocation. Hook failures are reported but do not block the workflow unless the project's `## Project-specific rules` section says otherwise.

| Hook                  | Fires when                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `post_spec`           | After the spec commit in step 3                |
| `post_plan`           | After the plan commit in step 4                |
| `post_implementation` | After the last implementation commit in step 5 |
| `post_pr`             | After `gh pr create` succeeds in step 7        |
| `post_ci_green`       | After step 8 turns green                       |

## Required-skills overrides

The profile's `## Required skills` table supports two operations on the pilot skill's universal required-skills table (defined in `references/required-skills.md`):

- **Replace.** A row matching an existing step swaps which skill fulfills it. Example: `Step 4 | my-project:writing-plans | replaces workbench:writing-plans`. The replacement fulfills that row instead of the universal one.
- **Additional.** A row marked `additional` adds a new mandatory skill at a step. Example: `Step 6 | my-project:custom-changelog | additional`. Both the universal row and the additional row apply.

Removal is not supported. The profile cannot weaken the universal discipline floor.

## Required skills semantics

The required-skills table (universal plus profile overrides) records which skill fulfills each step; it is not walked by a blocking check. `replaces` and `additional` rows still apply exactly as described above: a `replaces` row swaps the skill that fulfills a step, an `additional` row adds a mandatory skill at a step. There is no separate gate that re-confirms every row was invoked. `workbench:verification-before-completion` is the pre-PR gate, and it checks outcomes (fresh lint and test evidence, a diff read, docs lockstep) rather than re-deriving process compliance from tool-call history.

## Authoring tips

- Omit a heading if the project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` already documents the same information; the pilot skill will source it from session context.
- Use `## Project-specific rules` for pilot-coupled rules that don't naturally belong in `CLAUDE.md`, for example "before pytest, rebuild the PyO3 binding via `mise run solver:rebuild`."
- Keep the profile small. The kitchen-sink example exists to show all the dials, not as a target.
