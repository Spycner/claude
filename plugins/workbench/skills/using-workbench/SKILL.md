<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

## Instruction Priority

Workbench skills override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) - highest priority
2. **Workbench skills** - override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** - lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

## Triage: three lanes

### Step 0: is there anything to build?

Before routing to a lane, run the reflex ladder. Stop at the first rung that holds:

1. Does this need to be built at all? (YAGNI)
2. Does it already exist in this codebase? Reuse the helper, util, or pattern that is already here.
3. Does the standard library already do this?
4. Does a native platform feature cover it?
5. Does an already-installed dependency solve it?
6. Can this be one line?

If a rung holds, the answer is "do not build it", which is not a lane. Say which rung held and what to do instead. Only when all six fail does the task get a lane.

The ladder runs after you understand the problem, not instead of it: read the task and the code it touches, trace the real flow end to end, then climb. A ladder answer that skips comprehension is a guess.

If the `ponytail` plugin is installed its ruleset already covers this ground and takes precedence on the how; this step exists so the ladder still runs when it is absent.

### Lane routing

Route by cost of misunderstanding, blast radius, and reversibility, not by line count.

**Quick:** unambiguous intent, small blast radius, easy reversal (copy tweaks, obvious-repro bugs, config changes, one-off scripts). No design artifacts, no approval gate. The always-on disciplines below still apply.

**Medium:** one coherent feature, some alignment needed. A few targeted brainstorm questions, then one combined design and plan document. No separate spec.

**Large:** a new subsystem, a cross-cutting change, or a case where misunderstanding is expensive. Full pipeline: brainstorm grilling, spec, plan.

Propose the lane with one line of reasoning. The user confirms the lane when present. In a gateless `workbench:pilot` run, pilot decides the lane and records it in its deviation log.

**When unsure between two lanes, pick the lighter one.** Escalate to the heavier lane only when you can name a concrete reason the lighter one fails: a decision that is expensive to reverse, a blast radius beyond the files in front of you, a genuine disagreement about intent, or a requirement you cannot state in one sentence without guessing. "It feels big" is not a reason. An artifact nobody reads costs more than it saves.

Two exceptions outrank the lighter-lane default, because they protect against unrecoverable outcomes rather than wasted effort:

- The user asked for a spec, a plan, or a brainstorm. A named request is never downgraded.
- The work is destructive or hard to reverse (data migrations, deletions, auth or permission changes, public API breaks, anything touching money or credentials). Route heavy regardless of how small the diff looks.

## Always-on disciplines

These apply in every lane, regardless of routing:

- `workbench:test-driven-development` for any behavior change.
- `workbench:systematic-debugging` for any bug.
- `workbench:verification-before-completion` before claiming work is done, fixed, passing, ready, or safe to merge.
- A skill the user names by name is always invoked, regardless of lane.

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you, follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

**In Codex:** Skills are auto-discovered from installed plugins and activate via Codex's plugin skill mechanism.

## Platform Adaptation

Skills use Claude Code tool names by default. Codex users: see `references/codex-tools.md` for tool equivalents.

# Using Skills

## Skill Priority

Skill priority follows the lane, not a fixed process-first order:

- **Quick lane:** no process skills fire. Go straight to implementation skills, governed by the always-on disciplines above.
- **Medium and large lanes:** process skills fire first: `workbench:brainstorming`, then `workbench:writing-spec` in the large lane, then `workbench:writing-plans`. They determine HOW to approach the task before implementation skills guide execution.

"Let's build X" in the medium or large lane: brainstorming first, then implementation skills. In the quick lane: implementation skills directly.

## Skill Types

**Rigid**: Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.

## Coexistence with using-superpowers

Workbench coexists with the upstream `superpowers` plugin. If both are installed, both meta-skills (`using-workbench` and `using-superpowers`) may fire at session start. Their content overlaps but workbench's version is authoritative for workbench skills.

When a slug exists in both workbench and superpowers, prefer the workbench version. Today that includes `brainstorming`, `test-driven-development`, and `subagent-driven-development`. The host agent should resolve bare slugs such as `brainstorming`, `test-driven-development`, and `subagent-driven-development` to `workbench:brainstorming`, `workbench:test-driven-development`, and `workbench:subagent-driven-development`.

For attribution and a frozen snapshot of upstream `using-superpowers/SKILL.md` at v5.0.7, see `references/using-superpowers-upstream.md`. Workbench-specific divergences from that snapshot are documented in this file's git history; the snapshot itself is intentionally not edited.
